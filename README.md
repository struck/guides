Guides
======

An established code culture, written down. This gives us speed and efficency in onboarding and ongoings. 

Design sturdy apps, write code well. Be a BOSS. And a CHAMP.

- [Protocol](protocol): General development and architecture guidelines.
- [Coding Patterns and Practices](patterns-and-practices): A guide for programming well.
- [Code Style](code-style): A guide for programming in style.
- [Documentation](documentation): A guide for appropriate documentation.
- [Issue Tracking](issue-tracking): A guide for appropriate code and application documentation.
- [Code Review](code-review): A guide for reviewing code and having your code reviewed.

### High level guidelines:

Be consistent.
Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

### A note on the language:

"Avoid" means don't do it unless you have good reason.
"Don't" means there's never a good reason.
"Prefer" indicates a better option and its alternative to watch out for.
"Use" is a positive instruction.

### How To Contribute

- Open an issue specifically referencing the guideline and its location in the guides.
- Periodically review commits and comment as necessary on changes in commits.
